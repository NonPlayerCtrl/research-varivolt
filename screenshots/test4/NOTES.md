# Experiments notes

I am playing with Kalman matrix Q and R/S

Set 1: 

    Usd = 16
    Q = [0.5, 0; 0, 0.1]
    S = (Usd*1)^2

It seems not so good as Set#2

Set 2:

    Usd = 16
    Q = [0.1, 0; 0, 0.01]
    S = (Usd*1)^2

Set 3:

    Usd = 16
    Q = [0.3, 0; 0, 0.01]
    S = (Usd*1)^2
    
It seems not so good as Set #2
